# Why?

Atom don't provide native file-finder for recently opened file.  
While I'm working on multiple project, sometime I want to open single file from another project as reference, especially while I'm doing some sort of try&err.  
This package provide `recent-file-finder` **across** project.

Here is the list of finder-command and its target.

| Command                             | Target                         |
|:------------------------------------|:-------------------------------|
| `recent-finder:toggle`              | recent file **across** project |
| `fuzzy-finder:toggle-buffer-finder` | open buffer                    |
| `fuzzy-finder:toggle-file-finder`   | file within project            |

# Configuration

No default keymap.  
Configure whatever keymap you like in you `keymap.cson`.  

e.g.
```coffeescript
# Since both `cmd-p` and `cmd-t` are mapped to
# `fuzzyfinder:toggle-file-finder` by default.
# I use `cmd-p` for this.
'atom-workspace:not([mini])':
  'cmd-p': 'recent-finder:toggle'
```

# Commands

* `recent-finder:toggle`: toggle recent-finder
* `recent-finder:clear`: clear all entry, use this if you are in trouble.
